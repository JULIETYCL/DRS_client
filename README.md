# Drs Client
The DRS Client is a command-line tool designed for interaction with the Data Repository Service (DRS) Server. While there exists a SwaggerUI client for the DRS server, this tool stands out as a command-line client intended for use on Linux systems. It facilitates a host of actions, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting DrsObjects, as well as accessing their associated URLs and posting or retrieving service information. This simplified DRS client code forms a part of my CRYPT4GH internship project. Please note that any sensitive or unauthorized information has been purposely omitted for security purposes.

## How To Use
1. **Setting Up the Environment**: The DRS client runs on Ubuntu. Ensure that your machine has Ubuntu installed. I have utilized Ubuntu (20.04) on WSL2 within a Windows 11 environment. If you're operating a different version of Ubuntu, you may need to modify the relevant files to suit your setup.
2. **Downloading the DRS Server Code**: Access the DRS server code at **_https://github.com/elixir-cloud-aai/drs-filer_**
3. **Running the Server Code**: Execute the server code on your Ubuntu (20.04) using the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d â€“-build
```

Once the Docker container is constructed, you can verify the container's status using:

```
docker ps

```

If successful, ascertain the IP address for the WSL2 instance with:

```
ip addr show eth0 | grep -oP '(?<=inet\s)\d+(\.\d+){3}' 
```

In my case, the IP address is 172.27.46.118, port is 8080 ,I have set them as default in the code. However, please change it to your url and port when running the code in CLI


For different versions of Ubuntu, you might face version or port mapping issues, which can be resolved as follows:
 - Modify the base image in the Dockerfile, updating the image tag from 20201114 to a newer version:

 ```
 FROM elixircloud/foca:20201114`
 ```

 - Alter the port mapping in docker-compose.yaml to:

```
 ports:
            - "8081:8080"
```

Consequently, the base URL would change to
`base_url = "http://172.27.46.118:8081/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects"`

4. Once the server is up and running, you can start using the app. For ease of testing, follow these steps: 

(1) post call: ` python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 post` (this call will return a drs object id, e.g. `12345`)

(2) get call: `python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 get --expand false 12345` (`1234` is the obj id, you can find the access id from this call, e.g. 0000; --expand false is an option)

(3) access call: `python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 access 1234 0000` (`1234` is the obj id, `0000` is the obj's access id. This will return an access url)

(4)put call: `python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 put 1234 --updated-time "2024-04-16T18:56:55.077Z"` ( `1234` is the obj id, this function can be used to modify any option's content, for example the date and time)

(5) delete call:`python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 delete qUZcY.`

(6) delete_access call: `python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 delete_access_id 1234 0000` (Note: this call does not work on the server side)

(7) post_service_info: `python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 post_info --description "This service provides..."`

(8) get_service_info: `python3 drs.py --url 172.28.73.102 get_info`

## Usage 
Below is a description of all the actions available in the command-line client:

`post` - Register metadata of a data object.

`get` - Returns object metadata, and a list of access methods that can be used to fetch object bytes

`delete` - Delete existing DrsObject

`delete_access` - Delete existing AccessMethod of DrsObject.

`put` - Create a DRS object with a predefined ID. Overwrites any existing DRS object with the same ID.

`access` - Returns a URL that can be used to fetch the bytes of a DrsObject. This method only needs to be called when using an AccessMethod that contains an access_id (e.g., for servers that use signed URLs for fetching object bytes).

`post_service_info` - Delete existing AccessMethod of DrsObject.

`get_service_info` - A successful operation to request the service information about this running service.

The development is ongoing, with more functions and features being added. Therefore, this README is also a work in progress.
